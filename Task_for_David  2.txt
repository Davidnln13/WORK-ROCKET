Your task will be to investigate the space rocket game in the GS, then improve it. Requirements will be listed below. Make a folder "Task 2 - Rocket Game v1" and copy the GS into it.

The features for this version will be:

-Clear out the game area
-Create a canvas.
-Re-implement the rocket game in canvas, with following changes
	-No console/ counter
	-Rocket starts to fly in 5 seconds
	-Rocket moves toward a centre of the canvas
	-Ground area (find/ design a temporary) which goes off canvas downward
	-A background colour is day sky blue.
	
-Make fire via particles
	-https://www.davepagurek.com/blog/fire-particles-for-html5-canvas/
	-Encapsulate it into a separate class, which can do the following:
		-Create particle spawner in a specified position within rocket sprite. Assume parent-child relationship
		-Destroy all particle spawners
		-Set colour of the particles
		-Set size, quantity and life expectancy of the particles.
		-Set initial velocity and constant velocity.
		
-Add fire to the bottom of the rocket as it starts and as it flies
-Spawn new fire places on rocket per error
-If there are 3 errors - remove all the spawners.

For this task - the only area you expected to play with is the modal (https://designmodo.com/design-modal-windows/ ). You should also break this into sub-tasks based on the feature list and your own development plan. Do not aim to make it look perfect - make it work perfectly.
